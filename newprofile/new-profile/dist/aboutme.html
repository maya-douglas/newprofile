    <br>
    <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder with a major in computer science and minor in philosophy. I became interested in cybersecurity when I was 16, taught myself python at 17, and the rest is history!</p>

    <br>

    <p>My primary interest within computer science is ethical hacking. I have penetration tested networks and website applications for local companies. I've also participated in capture-the-flag challenges and bug bounty programs in my free time. If there's a vulnerability, I'll find it. </p>

    <br>
      
    <p>I have professional experience as a software developer for Travelport where I worked as a back-end application developer for United Airlines, Booking.com, and Expedia. I also automated a Jenkins pipeline that is still being used by every engineer at the company.</p>

    <br>
      
    <p>Besides my technical skills in technology, I also speak, read, and write in four languages - Japanese, English (fluent), Thai and Chinese (basic).</p>
