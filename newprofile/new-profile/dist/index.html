    <p>Hello, my name is Maya, and I am a cybersecurity professional with a passion for protecting organizations from digital threats. As a recent graduate in computer science with a specialization in cybersecurity, I have developed a deep understanding of the technical and strategic components of cybersecurity, including programming, network security, and risk management.</p>

    <br>

    <p>  My interest in cybersecurity began with a fascination with technology and a desire to help others navigate the digital landscape safely. Over the years, I have honed my skills by working on a variety of projects and gaining practical experience through internships and industry certifications.</p>

    <br>
      
    <p>  I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow in my field. With a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a dedication to staying on top of the latest trends and threats in cybersecurity, I am confident in my ability to make a meaningful contribution to any organization.</p>

    <br>
      
    <p>  Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon. </p>
