    <h3>I'm a computer science graduate with a love for cybersecurity. Check out my projects!</3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Permitted DoS Attack</h2>
    <p>Part of my school project was finding vulnerabilities within the school's framework. CU Boulder's computer science department uses a shared server to host Jupyter Notebook. Rumor said it wasn't sandboxed. Turns out the rumor was right as I took it down with a fork bomb.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Capture-the-flag Challenges</h2>
    <p>I have participated in capture-the-flag challenges both in and out of school. Using tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, and Telnet to find vulnerabilities within insecure networks. I executed a man-in-the-middle attack using python code for extra credit. In order to retain my skills I do CTF labs on HackTheBox.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Web Application Attacks - CSCI 3104 Final</h2>
    <p>The final exam for CSCI 3104, Introduction to Cybersecurity in a Converged World, was a set of website application attacks that I had to complete. This included cross-site scripting challenges with multiple levels of security, SQL Injections, and the use of password crackers.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Reverse-engineering Paper Mario</h2>
    <p>I managed to find the memory address that keeps track of health on Paper Mario using a Nintendo 64 emulator and Cheat Engine. No harm was done in the process as Paper Mario is a single player game.</p>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <h2>Mobile.bat Batch File</h2>
    <p>It only took four lines of script code to write a file that when clicked, would execute itself until it would crash my computer.</p>
